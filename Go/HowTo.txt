Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to install Go, set it up in VSCode on Windows 10, and run a simple "Hello, World!" program.


Step 1: Install Go
Download Go:

Visit the official Go downloads page (https://go.dev/dl/).
Download the installer for Windows (e.g., go1.x.x.windows-amd64.msi).
Run the Installer:

Double-click the .msi file and follow the installation wizard.
By default, Go will be installed in C:\Program Files\Go.
Set Environment Variables:

The installer automatically sets the GOPATH and adds C:\Program Files\Go\bin to your system's PATH.
To verify, open Command Prompt and run:
sh
Copy code
go version
You should see the installed Go version.


Step 2: Install VSCode and Go Extension
Install VSCode:

If you haven't already, download and install VSCode from code.visualstudio.com.
Install the Go Extension:

Open VSCode.
Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
Search for "Go" (by the Go team) and install it.


Step 3: Create a Go Project
Create a New Folder:

Open File Explorer and create a folder for your Go project (e.g., C:\GoProjects\HelloWorld).
Set Up Go Workspace:

Open the folder in VSCode (File > Open Folder).
Inside the folder, create a new file named main.go.
Write Your Code:

Paste the following code into main.go:
go
Copy code
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}


Step 4: Run the Program
Open a Terminal:

In VSCode, open the integrated terminal (`Ctrl+``).
Run the Go Program:

Execute the following command:
    go run main.go

You should see:
Copy code
Hello, World!


Optional: Build the Program
To create an executable, run:
    go build main.go
This will generate an main.exe file in the project folder.
Run the executable directly:
    ./main.exe
