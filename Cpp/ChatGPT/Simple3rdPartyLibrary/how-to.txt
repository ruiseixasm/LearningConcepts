Sure, here's a step-by-step process for using a third-party library in a C++ program:

    Choose a Library: Select a third-party library that you want to use. For the purpose of this example, let's use the "JSON for Modern C++" library (nlohmann/json) as it's simple and widely used.

    Download or Install the Library: Download the library files or install them using a package manager if available. For nlohmann/json, you can download the header-only library from its GitHub repository: https://github.com/nlohmann/json.

    Include the Library Header Files: In your C++ program, include the necessary header files from the library. For nlohmann/json, you only need to include the single header file "json.hpp" in your source code.

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include "json.hpp"

    Write Your Program: Write your C++ program, incorporating the functionality provided by the library. For example, let's create a simple program that parses a JSON string and prints its contents.

cpp

int main() {
    // Define a JSON string
    std::string json_string = R"({"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"})";

    // Parse the JSON string
    nlohmann::json json_data = nlohmann::json::parse(json_string);

    // Access JSON object elements
    std::cout << "Name: " << json_data["name"] << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Age: " << json_data["age"] << std::endl;
    std::cout << "City: " << json_data["city"] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

    Compile Your Program: Compile your C++ program, linking it with the third-party library if necessary. Since nlohmann/json is a header-only library, there's no need for additional linking.

bash

g++ -o my_program my_program.cpp

    Run Your Program: Run your compiled program to see the results.

bash

./my_program

That's it! You've successfully used a third-party library in your C++ program. This example demonstrates a basic usage of the nlohmann/json library for parsing and accessing JSON data. You can explore more advanced features and functionalities of the library as you become more familiar with it.



CLONE THE LIBRARY:
    git clone https://github.com/nlohmann/json.git
