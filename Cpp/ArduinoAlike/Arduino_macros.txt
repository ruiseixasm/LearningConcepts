Processor Macros:
    __AVR__: Defined for all AVR-based boards (like Arduino Uno,
        Mega, etc.).
    __arm__: Defined for ARM-based boards (like Arduino Due, Zero, 
        MKR series, etc.).
    __SAM__: Defined for SAM-based boards (such as Arduino Due).
    ARDUINO_ARCH_*: Specific to each architecture, like 
        ARDUINO_ARCH_AVR, ARDUINO_ARCH_SAM, ARDUINO_ARCH_SAMD, etc.

Board Macros:
    ARDUINO: Defined for all Arduino boards.
    ARDUINO_AVR_UNO, ARDUINO_AVR_MEGA2560, etc.: Specific board 
        definitions for various Arduino models.

Compiler Macros:
    __GNUC__: Defined if the GCC compiler is used.
    __ICCARM__: Defined if the IAR Embedded Workbench compiler is 
        used (for some ARM-based boards).
    ARDUINO_*: Various macros specific to the Arduino environment.

Version Macros:
    ARDUINO: The version of the Arduino IDE.
