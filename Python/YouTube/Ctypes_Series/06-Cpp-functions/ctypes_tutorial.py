# Command to be run
# python3 -u ctypes_tutorial.py 

# In Python, the -u flag stands for "unbuffered binary stdout and stderr".
#     When Python is run in unbuffered mode (-u), it means that the
#     standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) streams will be
#     flushed immediately after each write operation, instead of being buffered
#     and flushed periodically.

# This is particularly useful for ensuring that the output from your Python script
#     is displayed in real-time, especially when the script's output is being
#     redirected or piped to another program or process.

# So, in the command python3 -u ctypes_tutorial.py, the -u flag is ensuring that
#     the output produced by the ctypes_tutorial.py script is displayed
#     immediately without buffering.
