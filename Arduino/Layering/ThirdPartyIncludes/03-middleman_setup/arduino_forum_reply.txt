Ok, thanks for your reply and sorry for not seeing it earlier.

I'm trying to go a step forward by adding a `middleman.h` `include` between both files above and also I'm again in trouble with the compiler.

The files serial_com.h and `serial_com.cpp` are the same, now with the `Arduino.h` included like suggested.

These are the new files:

The `middleman.h` file:

```
#pragma once
#include "serial_com.h"

void middlemanSetup();
void middlemanLoop();
```

The `middleman.cpp` file:

```
#include "middleman.h"

void middlemanSetup()
{
    serialSetup(9600);
}

void middlemanLoop()
{
    // Intended to be implemented later
}
```


And now the final `middleman_serial.ino` file:

```
#include "middleman.h"

void setup()
{
    middlemanSetup();
}

void loop()
{
    middlemanLoop();
}
```


After your previous solution I was truly expecting this to work, but some how the compiler is still refusing to cooperate and now returns this:

```
Arduino: 1.8.19 (Linux), Board: "Arduino Uno"

sketch/middleman.cpp: In function ‘void middlemanSetup()’:
middleman.cpp:5:21: error: ‘serialSetup’ was not declared in this scope
     serialSetup(9600);
                     ^
exit status 1
‘serialSetup’ was not declared in this scope
```

Can you help me with this one, do I need to include Arduino.h all over the place, I did just that and still throws the same error!
