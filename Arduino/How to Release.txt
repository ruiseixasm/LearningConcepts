Setting Up Your Library in the Arduino Library Manager
To get your JsonTalkie library listed in the Arduino Library Manager (official repository), you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Verify Your Library Structure
Your library appears to be properly structured with:

The library files in an Arduino folder

A valid library.properties file

The required metadata (name, version, author, etc.)

2. Create a Release on GitHub
The Arduino Library Manager indexes libraries from GitHub releases:

Go to your repository: https://github.com/ruiseixasm/JsonTalkie

Click on "Releases" in the right sidebar

Click "Create a new release"

For the tag version, use the same version as in your library.properties (v1.0.0)

Set the release title (e.g., "JsonTalkie 1.0.0")

Add release notes describing the features/fixes

Click "Publish release"

3. Submit to Arduino Library Manager
There are two ways to get your library listed:

Option A: Automatic Submission (Recommended)
Create an issue in the Arduino Library Registry repository: https://github.com/arduino/library-registry/issues/new/choose

Select "Submit a Library to the Registry"

Fill out the form with your library details

The Arduino team will review and add it to the index

Option B: Manual Submission via Pull Request
Fork the library registry repo: https://github.com/arduino/library-registry

Add your library's metadata to registry.txt

Create a pull request with your changes

4. Additional Recommendations
Documentation: Add a README.md in your repository root with usage examples

Examples: Include example sketches in an examples folder

License: Add an open-source license file (recommend MIT or LGPL for libraries)

Versioning: Follow semantic versioning for future updates

5. After Submission
The Arduino team typically processes submissions within a few days. Once approved:

Your library will appear in Arduino IDE's Library Manager

Users can install it directly via "Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries"

Updates will be automatically indexed when you create new GitHub releases
