To set up your Arduino library on the official Arduino Library Manager, you need to submit it to their registry repository by making a request.

From what you've said, your library:

Is located in a subfolder (Arduino) inside a GitHub repository.

Already includes a valid library.properties.

Here are the exact steps to get it added:

✅ 1. Make Sure Your Repository Follows These Requirements
Arduino Library Manager expects:

Your library code to be in the root of the GitHub repo, or inside a single subfolder, e.g., Arduino/.

A valid library.properties at the top level of the library folder.

A tagged release in GitHub (e.g., v1.0.0).

From your description, you're already using a subfolder structure, so this is allowed.

✅ You have library.properties.

✅ 2. Create a GitHub Release
Go to your repo: https://github.com/ruiseixasm/JsonTalkie

Click "Releases" > "Draft a new release".

Tag version: v1.0.0 (must match the version in library.properties)

Title: v1.0.0

Description: (you can leave it simple like "Initial release")

Click "Publish release"

✅ 3. Submit to the Arduino Library Registry
Go to: https://github.com/arduino/library-registry/issues

Click "New Issue"

Choose "Library Submission Request"

Fill it out like this:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Repository: https://github.com/ruiseixasm/JsonTalkie
Library folder: Arduino
⚠️ Important: You must include Library folder: Arduino since your library isn't in the root.

✅ 4. Wait for Arduino CI to Approve It
Arduino maintainers will run checks (syntax, metadata, structure, etc.) and respond to your issue. If all goes well, your library will be added to the Library Manager within a few days.

✅ 5. After It’s Added
Your library will be installable via the Arduino IDE's Library Manager, by searching "JsonTalkie".










Setting Up Your Library in the Arduino Library Manager
To get your JsonTalkie library listed in the Arduino Library Manager (official repository), you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Verify Your Library Structure
Your library appears to be properly structured with:

The library files in an Arduino folder

A valid library.properties file

The required metadata (name, version, author, etc.)

2. Create a Release on GitHub
The Arduino Library Manager indexes libraries from GitHub releases:

Go to your repository: https://github.com/ruiseixasm/JsonTalkie

Click on "Releases" in the right sidebar

Click "Create a new release"

For the tag version, use the same version as in your library.properties (v1.0.0)

Set the release title (e.g., "JsonTalkie 1.0.0")

Add release notes describing the features/fixes

Click "Publish release"

3. Submit to Arduino Library Manager
There are two ways to get your library listed:

Option A: Automatic Submission (Recommended)
Create an issue in the Arduino Library Registry repository: https://github.com/arduino/library-registry/issues/new/choose

Select "Submit a Library to the Registry"

Fill out the form with your library details

The Arduino team will review and add it to the index

Option B: Manual Submission via Pull Request
Fork the library registry repo: https://github.com/arduino/library-registry

Add your library's metadata to registry.txt

Create a pull request with your changes

4. Additional Recommendations
Documentation: Add a README.md in your repository root with usage examples

Examples: Include example sketches in an examples folder

License: Add an open-source license file (recommend MIT or LGPL for libraries)

Versioning: Follow semantic versioning for future updates

5. After Submission
The Arduino team typically processes submissions within a few days. Once approved:

Your library will appear in Arduino IDE's Library Manager

Users can install it directly via "Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries"

Updates will be automatically indexed when you create new GitHub releases
